# Defeasible conditionals in Answer Set Programming

This project forms part of a larger honors project which
sorts to model defeasible conditionals in Answer Set
Programming. In this project repo we developed an
implemnetation of Base Rank and Rational Closure(RC)
outlined in paper
[Giovanni Casini, Thomas Meyer, Ivan Varzinczak, 2012](#1).
Furthermore, we developed a knowledge generator used
generate data for RC.
